            This Cinnamon Roll Wreath with apples for a sweet, delicious and
            festive breakfast recipe! It's easy to make in less than an hour
            with canned crescent roll dough, and it's perfect for holiday
            brunch, when decorated with cranberries and mint leaves.
          </h3>
          <h3>
            Crescent roll dough you can use canned crescent roll dough, or
            sheets of canned crescent dough. Either will work, the sheets of
            dough are simply a little easier to work with because you don't need
            to press the crescent roll perforations together. - Granulated sugar
            - Brown sugar - Ground cinnamon - Unsalted butter - you'll want the
            butter and cream cheese softened prior to making the recipe, so I
            recommend removing them from the refrigerator at least 30 minutes
            before starting the recipe, so they can come up to room temperature.
            - Pazazz apples - I purchased the apples at Vons in my area, click
            here to find out where you can buy these sweet, tart and extra
            crispy apples in your area! - Cream cheese - Milk - Vanilla extract
            - Powdered sugar

        <h2>8 Step by step instructions</h2>
        <div class="left_page">
          <p>
            1. Roll out the crescent roll dough. Place a large piece of
            parchment paper on a flat work surface. Place both sheets of
            crescent roll dough slightly overlapping on the parchment paper and
            press the seams together to form one large crescent roll rectangle.
          </p>
          <p>
            2. Top with the cinnamon sugar butter. In a medium bowl, combine
            softened butter with granulated sugar, brown sugar and ground
            cinnamon. Spread this mixture evenly across the crescent roll dough.
          </p>
          <p>
            3. Add the apples. Core and thinly slice one Pazazz apple, then
            place the slices on top of the cinnamon sugar butter in an even
            layer, not overlapping. Overlapping the apples will make it
            difficult to roll up and form into the wreath.
          </p>
          <p>
            4. Roll it up. Roll the crescent roll dough up tightly over the
            apples and the cinnamon sugar butter into a tube.
          </p>
          <p>
            5. Slice it in half.Use a sharp knife to slice lengthwise through
            the middle of the cinnamon roll tube.
          </p>
          <p>
            6. Separate the two halves. Once you've sliced the cinnamon roll
            tube in half, separate the two halves, and make sure the cinnamon
            butter and apples are facing up on both halves.
          </p>
          <p>
            7. Braid them together. Carefully braid the two halves together,
            lifting one half over the other, then vice versa until it's rolled
            up into one long braid.
          </p>
          <p>
            8. Form the wreath. Bring the two ends of the braid together to form
            the wreath, then transfer the wreath on the parchment paper over to
            a baking sheet. Bake at 350Â°F for 20-25 minutes, or until the entire
            cinnamon roll wreath is golden brown.
